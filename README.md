# Goodreads Data Analysis Portfolio
This repository showcases my data analysis skills using a dataset exported from my Goodreads account. As an avid reader, I have leveraged my reading data to explore and analyse various trends and insights. The project demonstrates my proficiency with SQL (here using SQLite, though my experience is mainly in PostgreSQL) and my ability to uncover insights through techniques such as window functions, data visualisation, and trend analysis.

Through this project, I aim to highlight my analytical skills and passion for working with data, combining my love for reading with my technical expertise. This portfolio is a work in progress, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions.

Feel free to explore the code, and thank you for visiting!
